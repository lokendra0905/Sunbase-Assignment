# Sunbase Form Builder

This project is a **visual form builder** where users can dynamically add, delete, reorder, and modify form elements. It allows the creation of forms with inputs, selects, and textareas, while also providing the ability to reorder these elements through drag-and-drop functionality. You can add options to select fields and edit labels and placeholders for form elements.

### 🖥️ **Live Demo**

The project is deployed on Netlify. You can view and interact with the form builder here:

## 📚 **Features**

- **Add Elements**: Users can add new input fields, select dropdowns, or textareas.
- **Edit Labels and Placeholders**: Each form element's label and placeholder are editable.
- **Manage Select Options**: You can add or delete options in select dropdowns.
- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder form elements using drag-and-drop. When an element is dropped, it is inserted into the desired position, and other elements shift accordingly.
- **Delete Elements**: Each form element has a delete button to remove it from the form.
- **Save Form**: The updated form structure is logged in the console in JSON format when you click the **Save** button.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5** for structuring the form and components.
- **CSS3** for styling the layout and form elements.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for handling dynamic functionality (adding, deleting, reordering, etc.).
- **Netlify** for deploying the live demo.
